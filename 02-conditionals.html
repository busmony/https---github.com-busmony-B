    // If...else statements
    // By far the most common type of conditional statement you'll use if JavaScript -- the 'if...else statements'.

    // Basic if...else syntax
    let age = 18;

    if (age > 18) {  // condition
      console.log("You can drive.") // code to run if conditon is true
    } else {
      console.log("You can't drive") // run some other code istead
    }

    // This code is pretty human-readable - it is saying
    // "if the condition returns true, run code A, else run code B"


    // You should note that you don't have to include the 'else' and
    // the second curly brace block - the following is also perfectly legal code:
    if (age > 18) { // condition
      console.log("You can drive.")// code to run if condition is true
    }
    // run some other code

    // However, you need to be careful here -
    // in this case, the second block of code is not controlled by the conditional statement,
    // so it always runs, regardless of whether the condition returns 'true' or 'false'.



    // else if
    // There is a way to chain on extra choices/outcomes to your if...else - using 'else if'.
    // Each extra choice requires an additional block to put between 'if () {} and else {}':

    // Nesting if...else
    // It is prefectly OK to put one if...else statement inside another one - to nest them.



    // Logical operators: AND, OR and NOT
    // If you want to test multiple conditions without writing nested 'if...else statements', logical operators can help you.
    // When used in conditions, the first two do the following:

    // 1. && - AND; allows you to chain together two or more expressions so that all of them have to individually evaluate to 'true' for whole expression to return 'true'.

    // 2. || - OR; allows you to chain together two or more expressions so that one or more of then have to individually evaluate to 'true' for the whole expression to return 'true'.
    let choice;

    if (choice === "sunny" && temperature < 86) {
      para.textContent = "It is nice and sunny outside today. Wear shorts! Go to the beach, or the park, and get the ice cream.";
    } else if (choice === "sunny" && temperature >= 86) {
      para.textContent = ""
    }

    // The first code block will only be run if 'choice === "sunny"' and temperature < 86 return 'true'.


    // OR example

    let iceCreanVanOutsice = true;

    if (iceCreanVanOutsice || houseStatus === "on fire") {
      console.log("You should leave the house quickly.");
    } else {
      console.log("Probably should just stay in then.");
    }


    // The last type of logical operator, NOT, expressed by the '!' operator,
    // can be used to negate an expression.
    // Let's combine it with OR :

    if (!(iceCreanVanOutsice || houseStatus === "on fire")) {
      console.log("Probably should just stay in then.");
    } else {
      console.log("You should leave the house quickly.");
    }

    // In this snippet, if the OR statement returns 'true', 
    // the NOT operator will negate it so that the overall expression returns 'false'.

    // You can combine as many logical statements together as you want,
    // in whatever structure.
